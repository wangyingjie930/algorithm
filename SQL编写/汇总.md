### 第二高的薪水
- desc: https://leetcode.cn/problems/second-highest-salary/description/?orderBy=most_votes

- ```sql
  select (SELECT DISTINCT
      Salary AS SecondHighestSalary
  FROM
      Employee
  ORDER BY Salary DESC
  LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) as SecondHighestSalary
  ```

  



### 第N高的薪水

- desc: https://leetcode.cn/problems/nth-highest-salary/description/?orderBy=most_votes

- ```sql
  CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
  BEGIN
    declare m INT;
    SET m = N-1;  
    RETURN (
        # Write your MySQL query statement below.
        select distinct salary from Employee order by salary desc limit 1 offset m
    );
  END
  ```





### 分数排名

- desc: https://leetcode.cn/problems/rank-scores/

- ```sql
  select 
      s1.score as score,
      (select count(distinct score) from Scores as s2 where s1.score <= s2.score) AS `rank`
  from Scores as s1
  order by score desc
  ```

- 解析: 

  - 先根据分数从大排到小写出框架

  - ```sql
    select 
        s1.score as score
        //.....
    from Scores as s1
    order by score desc
    ```

  - 然后根据对应分数获取大于该分数一共有多少人, 即他的排名(注意去重)





### 部门工资前三高的所有员工

- desc: https://leetcode.cn/problems/department-top-three-salaries/description/

- ```sql
  select
      dept.name as Department,
      e1.name as Employee,
      e1.salary as Salary
  from Employee as e1
  inner join Department as dept 
  on (dept.id = e1.departmentId)
  # 主要的逻辑在这: 查询比它分数高的不超过3个的话就是属于前3
  where 3 > (
      select count(distinct salary) as salary from Employee as e2
      where e2.salary > e1.salary and e2.departmentId = e1.departmentId
  )
  ```



### 删除重复的电子邮箱

- desc: https://leetcode.cn/problems/delete-duplicate-emails/description/?orderBy=most_votes

- ```sql
  DELETE p1 FROM Person p1,
      Person p2
  WHERE
      p1.Email = p2.Email AND p1.Id > p2.Id
  ```

- 这里有个知识点是delete p1

  - 一般来说是delete from table....的
  - 现在是delete table from table, **`DELETE p1`就表示从p1表中删除满足`WHERE`条件的记录。**
